Yeah Roll another one cause I’m random
And my four door looking really photogenic
Jam ‘em on the tire
Interesting won’t expire
I’m in the class up and all my teacher got fired
Money getting long pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the paint houses
Did it from the weak hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper,no sweat and sour
For she get the power then you get respect
I’m getting so much money I can buy you bitch
Take it how you wanna,if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Feel in love with the wrenches what the fuck I’m thinking
Bought that ho a ring it was for her pinky
Ah,that’s pimpin’ that’s slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie,no lie, already got a plat
Mama got a house,daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with an ounce
Bad bitches and deep boys would bring ‘em out
Hit them niggers pussy,we tush ‘em
We clean ‘em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work go to work don’t work at your residence
