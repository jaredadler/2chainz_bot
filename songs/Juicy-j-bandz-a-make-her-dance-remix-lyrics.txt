(Strippers!)

[Hook]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, Iâ&euro;&trade;m just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappinâ&euro;&trade;, and they ainâ&euro;&trade;t using hands

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Short hair, like Nia Long. loose ones, she donâ&euro;&trade;t need a loan
Start twerking when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some. So nasty when she rollinâ&euro;&trade;
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it! (Yeah ho)
She give me dome when the roof gone, at the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends, bring three. I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't
Racks errwhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwing racks
In the V.I.P, rubber on Iâ&euro;&trade;m stretching that
Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin'
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(... Baby...ha ha ah... Juicy I gotchya!)
(UGH!)
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smoking on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mother-fucking-bass-drum!
Two hoes on one fucking pole, two hoes on my fucking pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waiting on my bitch to cash out (Ha ha)
(...just waiting for my bitch to cash out!
Tunechi... Young Moula Baby)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz!)
2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap, standing ovation (TRU)
If yo girl dont swallow kids, man that ho basic
Got two bitches wit me: take a shot at one ho, using her friend for a chaser
(Bands a make her bust it) Buss it!
(Let me see you touch it)Touch it!
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion! (Damn!)
(Bands a make her do it) Do it!
(Pocket full of money) Money!
Young nigga gettin' head while tha engine runnin' (Errrgh!)
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga (Yeay!)
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is giggle
Ballin' in my coupe,call it sports car
Drop the top and freaky treat that bitch just like a pornstar!
