I'm all the way, turnt up with my burner
Broad disrespect me and I pimp, pimp, pimp, Ike Turner
Came form the gutta
The comer with my brother
I stood right by his side for the last ten summers
Smokin' on Obama and we doin' numbers
I just left the atm
My bank acount got commas
You just jumped on stage
Aka Lil'Mama
Ah look at these two chains
They aka retarted
Yeah, regardless I'm a keep on gettin' grawlers
And I pop her pussy
Like I pop my collar
Panamera porsh
Pameramic top
Hang out the roof
Jack in the box
I got sacks in the sock
Packs in mi casa
You got chickens in your freezer
I got chickens in my closet
Still sippin' syrup
Even Wayne couldn't stop me
And I'm so dam high
An airplane couldn't top me
And my campainge poppin'
Champange poppin'
Watch so airigent
Pinkyring coky
My broad got freatures
My car got options
And nigga I'm turnt up
End of discussion
