I'm so- I'm so turned up with these hood bitches
Diamonds on my neck and wrist, call it hood rich
But on some hood shit, I fuck with the real niggas
In the trap with the goonies and the drug dealers

[Verse 4- Gucci Mane]
This Hood Rich radio you better not change the station

I'm a trapper slash rapper thats that's my occupation
And I don't carry chump change, all I do is carry faces
I'm an athlete, I ball, I think I'm Dominique
