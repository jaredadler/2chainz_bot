Damn right I got it, damn right I got it
(Repeat x4)

I said lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
You in the presence of a real nigga
I said lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
You in the real nigga presence

[Verse 1]
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won’t save you no extra
Say she fucking with me cause a real nigga's her preference
Drink like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexing
And if you don't know I go by Tity 2 Necklace

[Hook]
Damn right I got it, damn right I'm 'bout it
Clique full of killers, please don’t get us excited
Ill smoking loud, so lame niggas be quiet
And if you fuck with us we gon' start up a riot

I'mma start a riot, I'mma start a riot
(Repeat x4)

[Verse 2]
Ain't stunting these niggas, ain't stunting these bitches
Two cigarillos, look like extensions
Yeah I’m from the Southside, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud I back out, and click clack, pow pow
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
An hour later, alligators, I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I’m down, her phone off so don’t dial
This right here is that no style, I don’t know how I do the shit
I’m true to this, True Religion
They taking swag with no permission
All year, it’s Gucci season, G's on my belt buckle
Cocaine on my left knuckle, kill you and bury what's left of you

[Hook]
